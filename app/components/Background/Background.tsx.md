### Overview 
This component renders a visually appealing background with multiple colored objects. The objects are positioned and styled using CSS to create a dynamic and visually interesting design.

### Usage
To use the Background component, simply import it into your React application and render it as a standard component.

```javascript
import Background from './Background';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Background />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Props
The Background component does not accept any props.

### CSS
The Background component utilizes the following CSS classes and styles:

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `h-min` | Sets the height of the container to the minimum value needed to contain its children. |
| `bgObject` | Styles the background objects with common properties. |
| `purple`, `blue`, `cyan`, `pink` | These IDs are applied to the background objects and are used to target them with specific styles. |

### Example
The following example shows how the Background component can be used in a React application:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Background from './Background';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Background />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This will render a background with four colored objects. ðŸŽ¨
