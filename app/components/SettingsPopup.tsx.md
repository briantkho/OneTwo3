    </div>
  );
}
```

### Implementation Details

The `SettingsPopup` component is implemented as follows:

* **JSX Structure**:
    * The component is rendered as a `div` with the following classes:
        * `z-50`: Sets the z-index to 50, ensuring the popup is visible on top of other elements.
        * `absolute`: Positions the popup absolutely within its parent container.
        * `glass-bg`: Applies a transparent background style.
        * `px-4 py-2`: Adds padding to the popup.
        * `rounded-sm`: Applies a slight border radius to the popup.
        * `flex`: Enables flexbox layout for the popup.
        * `w-min`: Sets the width to the minimum required size.
    * The popup contains an inner `div` with the following classes:
        * `flex flex-col`: Enables flexbox layout and arranges items vertically.
        * `items-start`: Aligns items to the start of the container.
        * `w-full`: Sets the width to the full available space.
    * The inner `div` contains two child `div` elements:
        * The first child `div` is used to display the "Edit" button and the close button.
            * It uses the following classes:
                * `flex justify-between`: Aligns items to opposite ends of the container.
                * `items-center`: Centers items vertically.
                * `w-full`: Sets the width to the full available space.
            * It contains an "Edit" button and a `VscChromeClose` icon from the `react-icons/vsc` library.
            * The `VscChromeClose` icon is styled with the following classes:
                * `cursor-pointer`: Sets the cursor to a pointer.
                * `text-xs`: Sets the font size to extra small.
            * The icon is given an `onClick` handler that calls the `handlePopup` prop.
        * The second child `div` displays the "Delete" button.
            * It is given an `onClick` handler that calls the `handleDelete` prop.

* **Icon Import**: The `SettingsPopup` component imports the `VscChromeClose` icon from the `react-icons/vsc` library.

* **Function Signature**: The component is defined as a functional component that accepts two props:
    * `handlePopup`: A callback function to handle closing the popup.
    * `handleDelete`: A callback function to handle deleting the settings.

* **Styling**: The component utilizes the Tailwind CSS framework for styling.
