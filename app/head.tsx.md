## Overview 

This documentation outlines the functionality of the `Head` component, which is responsible for defining the head section of a webpage. 

## Functionality 

The `Head` component provides essential metadata and settings for the webpage, including:

* **Title:** Sets the title that appears in the browser tab.
* **Viewport:** Defines the viewport settings, ensuring optimal responsiveness across devices.
* **Description:** Provides a brief description of the webpage, used by search engines.
* **Favicon:** Specifies the icon displayed in the browser tab and bookmarks.

## Usage

The `Head` component is typically used as a child of the `_app.jsx` file in Next.js applications. This ensures that the metadata is included on all pages of the website.

## Parameters

The `Head` component does not accept any parameters.

## Return Value

The `Head` component returns a React fragment (`<>`) containing the following elements:

* `<title>`: Sets the page title to "OneTwo3".
* `<meta>`: Defines viewport settings with a width of `device-width` and initial scale of `1`.
* `<meta>`: Sets the page description to "Your new you starts here".
* `<link>`: Links to the favicon located at `/favicon.ico`.

## Example

```javascript
// _app.jsx
import Head from '../components/Head';

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  );
}
```

This example demonstrates how the `Head` component is used within the `_app.jsx` file to provide essential metadata for the website.
