### Overview

The `JournalsPage` component is responsible for displaying a user's journals, providing a form to create new journals, and potentially allowing for the linking of journals to related goals, habits, and tasks.

### Component Structure

The `JournalsPage` component is composed of the following elements:

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| `JournalCard` | Renders a single journal entry. |
| `JournalForm` | Provides a form for creating new journal entries. |

```javascript
import JournalCard from './JournalCard';
import JournalForm from './JournalForm';

export default function JournalsPage() {
  // !!! Add relational linking to goals, habits, tasks
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-10">
      <p className="header">My Journals</p>
      <JournalForm />
      <JournalCard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Component Usage

The `JournalsPage` component is intended to be used as a standalone page within a larger application. It renders a list of journal entries, a form for creating new entries, and will eventually provide functionality for linking journals to other related data points.

### Future Enhancements

* **Relational Linking:** Implement the functionality to link journal entries to goals, habits, and tasks. This could involve displaying related items within the `JournalCard` component or providing options to link entries during the creation process. 
* **Filtering and Sorting:** Allow users to filter and sort their journals based on criteria such as date, category, or keywords.
* **Data Visualization:** Consider incorporating charts or graphs to visualize data from journals, such as trends in mood or productivity over time.
