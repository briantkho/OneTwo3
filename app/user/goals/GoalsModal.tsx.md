### Introduction 

This component implements a modal for creating new goals. It leverages the Supabase database to store goal data, handles user input, and utilizes a state management system for controlling modal visibility.

### Code Overview

This code defines a React component `GoalsModal` responsible for displaying and managing the goal creation modal. It interacts with the Supabase database, manages user input, and utilizes a custom state management system.

**Component Breakdown:**

| Code Section | Description |
|---|---|
| `'use client';` |  Indicates this component should be rendered on the client-side. |
| `import Modal from '@/app/components/Modal/Modal';` | Imports the `Modal` component, which serves as a base for the goal creation modal. |
| `import { CategoryInput } from '@/app/utils/CategoryInputs';` | Imports `CategoryInput` object containing input fields specific to goals. |
| `import { CategoryTypes } from '@/app/utils/CategoryTypes';` | Imports `CategoryTypes` object containing pre-defined category names. |
| `import { useState } from 'react';` | Imports `useState` hook from React for managing component state. |
| `import { createClient } from '@/app/utils/supabase-browser';` | Imports `createClient` function to initialize Supabase client. |
| `import { useGoalModalStore } from '@/app/utils/stateManager';` | Imports `useGoalModalStore` hook from custom state management system. |
| `export default function GoalsModal() { ... }` |  Defines the `GoalsModal` component. |
| `const toggleModal = useGoalModalStore((state) => state.setModalStateFalse);` |  Retrieves a function from the state manager to close the modal. |
| `const supabase = createClient();` |  Initializes a Supabase client. |
| `const [values, setValues] = useState({ ... });` |  Defines state for managing input values. |
| `const onChange = (e: any) => { ... };` |  Handles input value changes, updates state. |
| `const handleSubmit = async (e: any) => { ... };` |  Handles form submission, performs data validation, and sends data to the database. |
| `const data = { ... };` |  Creates an object containing data passed to the `Modal` component. |
| `return ( ... );` |  Renders the `Modal` component with provided data. |

**Key Features:**

* **Modal Structure:** Utilizes a reusable `Modal` component to provide a standard modal interface.
* **Supabase Integration:** Leverages Supabase for database interactions, including user authentication and data storage.
* **User Input Handling:** Manages user input through state management and event handlers.
* **Data Validation:** Validates input data before submitting to the database.
* **State Management:** Utilizes a custom state management system for controlling modal visibility.

### Component Usage

The `GoalsModal` component is used as a standalone modal for creating new goals within the application. It can be triggered programmatically or through user interactions. The component interacts with Supabase for data persistence and relies on a custom state management system for controlling its visibility. 

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
// Trigger the GoalsModal from another component
<button onClick={() => toggleGoalModal(true)}>Create New Goal</button> 
```

**Expected Behavior:**

When triggered, the `GoalsModal` component will appear as a modal overlay. Users can input their goal information, including title, description, and end date. Upon submitting the form, the data will be validated and sent to the Supabase database for storage. Upon successful submission, the modal will close, and the application will reload to reflect the newly created goal. 

**Note:** The component relies on proper setup of the Supabase client and database schema for functionality.
