### Overview 

This component implements the landing page for the application. It provides a visually appealing introduction to the platform, highlighting key features and encouraging user sign-up.

### Component Structure

The `LandingPage` component is a functional component that utilizes the following elements:

* **`Link` component (from `next/link`):** This component enables navigation to the signup page.
* **`Navbar` component:** This component is imported and used to render the navigation bar.

### Usage

The `LandingPage` component is designed to be rendered as the root component for the application's landing page. 

**Example:**

```javascript
import LandingPage from './components/LandingPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <LandingPage />
  );
}
```

### Styling

The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling:

| Class Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `flex flex-col justify-center items-center gap-10` |  Sets the main section to be a vertical flexbox container, aligning items to the center and spacing them by 10 units. |
| `header w-min text-center landing-title` |  Styles the main heading to be centered, with a minimum width, and applies the `landing-title` class for custom styling. |
| `flex flex-col justify-center items-center gap-5` |  Styles the button container to be a vertical flexbox container, aligning items to the center and spacing them by 5 units. |
| `gradient-btn landing-btn` |  Styles the button with a gradient background and applies the `landing-btn` class for custom styling. |
| `landing-height` |  Sets the height of the main section using a custom CSS class. |

**Additional Notes:**

* The `landing-height` and `landing-title` styles are likely defined in a separate CSS file or using inline styles. 
* The `gradient-btn` class suggests the button has a gradient background, which is likely defined using CSS.
